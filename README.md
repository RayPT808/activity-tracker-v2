# The Activity Tracker

As a personal trainer and a hobby triathlete I always trying to keep track of my activities through popular platforms such as
Strava or Garmin Connect. As the these platforms improved over the years more and more details, insights became available foruserslike myself. The accessible data with regards to one's activity sometimes it is a bit overwhelming and pointles because as an avarage person many of those metrics will not matter for us. Within the details it's easy to lose the focus on the fundemantal goal that we just want to be active and we would like to record it in a simple, not confunsing way. This was how the idea of my fith project for the Code Institute course was born.

## The vision...

Strava and Garmin Connect are the Apple and Microsoft of activity tracking in these days, so using their products and services I tried follow their example but I imagined a rather simplified version. Both platforms could provide libraries and API's for developers.
https://developers.strava.com/
https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/activity-api/
However looking into more Strava's API Agreement seems complex, restrictive and me question that for something simple that I want do I really need all of that. Garmin was a different story an application had to be sent to them in order to gain acces their libraries, APIs. This application of mine was rejectet pretty swiftly. After this I just tied to focus on what I want to create.
Started to go through the user's journey of an activity platform and outlined the essential user stories.

At next I visualized a user friendly interface where all the required functions are easy to spot and use.

This was my idea that I proudly presentet to my tutor. However some research and meetings with my tutor made me realise I don't have the techniqual skills, experience or time to create something that like the initial idea was, plus to launch an MVP product I don't even need all of that.
